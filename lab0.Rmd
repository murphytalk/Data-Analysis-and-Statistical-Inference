Read in your data set and assign to the object:

```{r}
present <- read.table("http://assets.datacamp.com/course/dasi/present.txt")
```

`present` will print your data set in the console:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
present
```

Print the number of rows and variables:
```{r}
dim(present)
```

Print the names of the variables of the data frame:
```{r}
names(present)
```

We can tell there are 3 vaibales (year,boys,girls) in the present data set.

Find the number of boys and girls born each year, and assign answers to variables:
```{r}
num_boys <-present$boys
num_girls <- present$girls
num_boys
num_girls
```

The result is in data type *vector*.
